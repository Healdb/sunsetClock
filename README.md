# sunsetClock
Just a simple Pebble watch face I made. It is a fork of the "simplicity" default watch face with some added features!

<strong>Features:</strong>
Sunset time determined by your phone's location
The day of the week
The date in the format MM/DD/YY
The horizontal line that was on this watch face has been replaced with a line that slowly shrinks with your battery percentage
The time in large font
